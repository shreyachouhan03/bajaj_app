Simple Explanation:
Think of this like a simplified stock trading app (like Zerodha or Upstox). Users can:
-  View available stocks to trade
-  Buy or sell stocks (place orders)
-  Check order status
-  View their portfolio (stocks they own)
-  See trade history

Technical Explanation:
This is a REST API built with Python FastAPI that simulates a stock trading backend. It provides endpoints to manage:
- Instruments (stocks available for trading)
- Orders (buy/sell requests)
- Trades (executed orders)
- Portfolio (user's stock holdings)
